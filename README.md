# Bayesian-Optimization

Given a classification problem, the goal is to fine-tune the hyperparameters for loss minimization of the model

Challenges: Traditional optimization methods struggle due to the high cost of evaluating 

Benchmark accuracy with a grid-search algorithm on a CNN, time with a random grid search
